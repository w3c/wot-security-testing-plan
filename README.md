# WoT Security Testing Plan
This is the repository for the
W3C Web of Things (WoT) Security Testing Plan document.
This is a work in progress and should not be cited as an
authoritative source.

* [WoT Security Testing Plan](index.html): A set of suggestions on 
how security and privacy aspects of WoT systems can be tested.

If you wish to make a contribution,
please be aware that since the master is being linked from other WoT documents
we want to keep it as stable as possible and are staging commits through
the "working" branch.
Issues and pull requests should be made to that branch, not master.
Conversely, if you want to see the latest (unstable) version,
checkout the "working" branch.
Issues should be filed against the working branch and will be closed when
updates are released to the master branch.
